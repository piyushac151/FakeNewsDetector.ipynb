Just two hours after a city-wide seismic drill to mark the earlier tragedy, Mexico City was shaken by a magnitude 7.1 quake, its second major tremor in less than two weeks, which killed at least 100 people in the capital and 230 nationwide.  The annual drill is a legacy of the 1985 quake, a harrowing disaster imprinted on the national psyche after claiming over 5,000 lives in Mexico City. In a country with a long history of supernatural beliefs, the timing of the quakes triggered conspiracy theories and reopened old wounds.  It seems like a thing of the devil,  said Luis Pastrana, a 52-year-old industrial designer who lived through both tremors.  Another Cursed September 19,  Mexican daily El Economista proclaimed on its front page on Wednesday.  In Tlatelolco, a modernist housing project, residents gather every Sept. 19 for morning mass at the site where two tower blocks collapsed 32 years ago, killing hundreds.  On Tuesday, when the ground began to shake several hours after the service, locals swarmed the historic plaza where they congregate after each quake, crying and praying. Some suffered panic attacks. Some were positing that the Mexican government must have known the temblor was coming, and others speculated that North Korea was involved, said Antonio Fonseca, 66, a local history expert.   They believe fantastical things,  he said.  Since there is no explanation, there are lots of rumors.  Situated at the intersection of three tectonic plates, Mexico is one of the world s most earthquake-prone countries, and the capital is particularly vulnerable due to its location on top of an ancient lake bed. Tuesday s quake striking on the 1985 anniversary appeared to be purely coincidental, said Jana Pursley, a geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey, noting that the epicenters were hundreds of kilometers apart. But for some Mexico City residents, the timing may have made lingering anxieties more acute, said Elizabeth Willems, a local psychologist who has treated patients coping with post-traumatic stress disorder from the 1985 disaster.  In a phenomenon known as the  anniversary effect,  distress levels can spike as the date of a traumatic event approaches, Willems said. The repetition of the event would have compounded the stress, she added.  Willems said she had heard from some of her patients who were rattled by the latest quake. The trauma of the 1985 tremor frequently arises, she said.  It s almost like working with someone who was in Manhattan during the events of September 11. It s almost a question I ask automatically: Where were you that day?  she said. Maria del Carmen Herrera, a 60-year-old resident of the Juarez neighborhood who survived the 1985 quake, said she was struck by a premonition during the earthquake drill on Tuesday morning.   I was afraid. I thought, it s going to shake,  she said.  Those of us who survived 1985, we re left marked forever.  For Fonseca, nothing can compare to the devastation of the 1985 quake. But as he watched the ceiling trembling in his 10th-floor apartment on Tuesday, he feared the worst.  I say that coincidences don t exist,  he said.  This was something I don t know how to classify.   \",\n          \"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\\u2019s order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States sparked confusion and anger on Saturday after immigrants and refugees were kept off flights and left stranded in airports. In his most sweeping decision since taking office a week ago, Trump, a Republican, put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other countries. Civil rights and faith groups, activists and Democratic politicians were furious and vowed to fight the order. Capping a day of confusion and chaos and protests in several airports across the country, a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, granted a temporary reprieve. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travelers to stay in the United States. Supporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. The court action does not reverse Trump\\u2019s order, which was criticized by some of America\\u2019s closest allies. Trump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \\u201cextreme vetting\\u201d of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the White House\\u2019s Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \\u201cnot a Muslim ban\\u201d and said the measures were long overdue. \\u201cIt\\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\\u201d Trump said. Along with Syria, the ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. The order \\u201caffects a minor portion of international travelers,\\u201d the department said in a statement, saying the measures \\u201cinconvenienced\\u201d less than 1 percent of travelers.\\u00a0 The new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. Pegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington\\u2019s Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \\u201cThey weren\\u2019t treating them very well,\\u201d she said. Rahmani\\u2019s grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. Several Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think anyone is going to take this lying down,\\u201d said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \\u201cThis is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\\u201d The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.  The Department of Homeland Security said the order would stay in place. \\u201cNo foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States,\\u201d the department statement said. Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called lawsuits challenging the order \\u201clast ditch efforts\\u201d that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \\u201cThe first amendment doesn\\u2019t apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\\u201d Krikorian said. Some leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \\u201cThis ban will impact many innocent people,\\u201d said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. Arab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. Sudan called the action \\u201cvery unfortunate\\u201d after Washington  lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. Iraq\\u2019s former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump\\u2019s ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \\u201cWe have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. Allies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. Confusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. However, senior administration officials said it would have been \\u201creckless\\u201d to broadcast details of the order in advance. Other officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. Airlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. Travelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. At Chicago O\\u2019Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. They knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t think he\\u2019d actually do it,\\u201d Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \\u201cA lot of politicians just talk.\\u201d Thousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. Trump\\u2019s order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. At the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \\u201cnational interest.\\u201d However, a federal law enforcement official said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"worldnews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"December 14, 2017 \",\n          \"August 23, 2017 \",\n          \"Jun 23, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
